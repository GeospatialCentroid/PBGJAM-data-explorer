# PBGJAM-data-explorer
Codebase for the PBGJAM website: https://pbgjam.org


### File Structure:

- **app.R** : Contains all code to run the app. Running this script will open the application in a preview window.
- **data/** : This folder **is not on GitHub**, but should be placed in the main folder with the app.R script. This folder is added to the .gitigore to remain local as the storage size is too high.
- **www/** : This folder contains all images on the website, as well as CSS styling files ("style.scss" sets styles for the entire application, "homepage.css" sets styles specific to the app homepage).
- **google_anlaytics.html** : This is an HTML tag added to the app.R script to link the site to Google Analytics. This file should not be edited.
